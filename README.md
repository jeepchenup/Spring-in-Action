This project is a source code that references from “Spring in Action 4th edition”.

Although most of the source code implementations are available in this book, there are a few details that do not fit in.

At the same time, our local environment is different, which may lead to some detailed configuration differences. Above factors prompted me to rewrite a complete source code.
